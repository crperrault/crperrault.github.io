<div class="psNotesTitle">Notes for Sir William Vallance Whiteway</div>

<div class="psNotesData"><b>Sir William Vallance Whiteway,</b> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%2527s_Counsel"><font color="#090073">QC</a></font> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_St_Michael_and_St_George"><font color="#090073">KCMG</a></font> (April 1, 1828 – June 24, 1908) was a politician and three time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier"><font color="#090073">Premier</a></font> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_of_Newfoundland"><font color="#090073">Newfoundland</a></font>. Born in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"><font color="#090073">England</a></font>, Whiteway emigrated to the island in 1843 and entered the law in 1852. In 1859 he was elected to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Assembly"><font color="#090073">House of Assembly</a></font> as a member of the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_of_Newfoundland"><font color="#090073">Conservative Party of Newfoundland</a></font> and became a supporter of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_confederation"><font color="#090073">Canadian confederation</a></font>. He lost his seat in the 1869 election on confederation but returned in 1874 and served as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor"><font color="#090073">Solicitor-General</a></font> in the government of Sir <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Carter"><font color="#090073">Frederick Carter</a></font> before becoming Premier in 1878 when he succeeded Carter as leader of the Conservatives. He was made a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%2527s_Counsel"><font color="#090073">Queen's Counsel</a></font> in 1865. While serving as Solicitor-General, Whiteway was one of the counsel representing the British Government before the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halifax_Fisheries_Commission"><font color="#090073">Halifax Fisheries Commission</a></font>, which adjudicated a dispute over north Atlantic fishing rights between the British Empire and the United States. The Commission gave an award of $5,500,000 to be paid by the United States to the British Government.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Whiteway#cite_note-1"><font color="#090073">[1]</a></font>Newfoundland received $1,000,000 as its share of the award.<br />Whiteway's major policy ambition was the construction of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway"><font color="#090073">railway</a></font> spanning the island which was begun in 1881 and which he believed would spur economic development of the colony. In 1885 his Conservative party was destroyed by sectarian riots at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbour_Grace"><font color="#090073">Harbour Grace</a></font> which resulted in several<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant"><font color="#090073">Protestants</a></font> leaving the Whiteway government in protest over its conciliatory attitude towards <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic"><font color="#090073">Catholics</a></font>. Leading the dissenters was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Spearman_Winter"><font color="#090073">James Spearman Winter</a></font>, Whiteway's Solicitor-General and grand master of Newfoundland's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Institution"><font color="#090073">Orange Order</a></font>.<br />The Orangemen joined with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Thorburn"><font color="#090073">Robert Thorburn</a></font>, an opponent of Whiteway's railway who felt that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony"><font color="#090073">colony</a></font> should focus on the fishery, to form the Reform Party and win the 1885 election on a Protestant Rights platform.<br />In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Opposition"><font color="#090073">Opposition</a></font> Whiteway founded a new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Newfoundland"><font color="#090073">Liberal Party of Newfoundland</a></font> which won office in 1889 returning Whiteway as Premier on the issue of the railway. His government was forced to resign in 1894, however, due to allegations of electoral corruption in the previous year's election.<br />The Tories had argued that Whiteway's Liberals had promised jobs to Newfoundlanders who voted for him and filed petitions in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Canada"><font color="#090073">Supreme Court</a></font> under the Corrupt Practices Act against fifteen Liberal members of the House alleging bribery and corruption. The members were tried and found guilty and their seats were declared vacant. On April 3, 1894, while the trials were still underway, Whiteway asked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor"><font color="#090073">Governor</a></font> Sir <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Murray"><font color="#090073">Herbert Murray</a></font> to dissolve the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Assembly"><font color="#090073">House of Assembly</a></font> for a new election. The governor refused and asked the Tory leader, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_F._Goodridge"><font color="#090073">Augustus F. Goodridge</a></font> to form a government despite the fact that the Tories had only 12 seats to 21 for the Liberals. As Liberal seats were declared vacant due to guilty verdicts the standings in the House at the end of the process in August were 8 Conservatives, 9 Liberals and 19 vacancies. Whiteway himself had been found guilty, his seat declared vacant, and under the provisions of the law he was barred from seeking election to the House of Assembly or sitting in government.<br />The Governor enabled Goodridge to remain in office by continually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_session#Procedure_in_Commonwealth_realms"><font color="#090073">proroguing</a></font> the House in order to prevent the government's fall through a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_No_Confidence"><font color="#090073">Motion of No Confidence</a></font>.<br />By-elections were held throughout the fall in which the Liberals retained the seats they had been disbarred from, losing just two, while picking up two from the Conservatives in return. The last by-election was held on November 12, 1894, a full year after the general election. In the interim, 21 by-elections had been held, resulting in a virtual return to the status quo.<br />Goodridge remained as premier until December 12, 1894, two days after the failure of two banks crippled the economy. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_J._Greene"><font color="#090073">Daniel J. Greene</a></font>, acting Liberal leader, was sworn in as premier the next day.<br />His government passed the Disabilities Removal Act, which allowed all those members who had been disqualified to run as candidates as well as sit in government. Greene then resigned so that Whiteway could be sworn in as premier for a third time.<br />Whiteway's Liberals lost the 1897 election, resulting in his retirement from politics. He was succeeded as Liberal leader by Sir <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bond"><font color="#090073">Robert Bond</a></font>.<br />[<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Whiteway&action=edit&section=1"><font color="#090073">edit</a></font>]<br />Family<br />The Hon. William Vallance Whiteway, Q.C., married as his second wife, October 22, 1872, Catherine Anne Davies, daughter of W. H. Davies, of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictou,_Nova_Scotia"><font color="#090073">Pictou, Nova Scotia</a></font>.
