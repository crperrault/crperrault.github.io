<div class="psNotesData"><a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Goodridge_MacDonald">http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Goodridge_MacDonald</a><br /><br />Life<br />Goodridge MacDonald was born in <a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Fredericton,_New_Brunswick"><font color="#461d8b">Fredericton, New Brunswick</a></font>, to Samuel Archibald Roberts MacDonald, a druggist, and <a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Jane_Elizabeth_MacDonald"><font color="#461d8b">Jane Elizabeth MacDonald</a></font>, the sister of <a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Confederation_Poets"><font color="#461d8b">Confederation Poet</a></font> Sir <a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Charles_G.D._Roberts"><font color="#461d8b">Charles G.D. Roberts</a></font> and a poet in her own right.<a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Goodridge_MacDonald#cite_note-houlihan-0"><font color="#461d8b">[1]</a></font><br />MacDonald moved with his family in 1912 to <a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Nelson,_British_Columbia"><font color="#461d8b">Nelson, British Columbia</a></font>, where he attended Nelson High School; to <a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Winnipeg"><font color="#461d8b">Winnipeg</a></font>, <a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Manitoba"><font color="#461d8b">Manitoba</a></font> in 1914; then, after his parents separated, to <a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Ottawa"><font color="#461d8b">Ottawa</a></font> with his mother in 1915.<a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Goodridge_MacDonald#cite_note-houlihan-0"><font color="#461d8b">[1]</a></font><br /><a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/World_War_I"><font color="#461d8b">World War I</a></font> was raging at that time, and after a brief stint in the civil service, MacDonald enlisted in 1916. He served in <a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/France"><font color="#461d8b">France</a></font> with the Queen's Field Ambulance, <a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Canadian_Expeditionary_Force"><font color="#461d8b">Canadian Expeditionary Force</a></font>, in 1917 and 1918. He was honorably discharged due to poor health.<a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Goodridge_MacDonald#cite_note-houlihan-0"><font color="#461d8b">[1]</a></font> His first <a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Chapbook"><font color="#461d8b">chapbook</a></font> of poetry, Armageddon and Other Poems, was published in 1917.<a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Goodridge_MacDonald#cite_note-trehearne-1"><font color="#461d8b">[2]</a></font><br />After the war MacDonald worked as a freelance journalist. By 1925 &quot;he was working for the <a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Montreal_Herald"><font color="#461d8b">Montreal Herald</a></font> and rose to become its associate editor.&quot;<a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Goodridge_MacDonald#cite_note-trehearne-1"><font color="#461d8b">[2]</a></font> The Herald was &quot;a prominent newspaper that supported the British constitution,&quot; which &quot;served as a voice for well educated British men and expressed ideals that reiterated liberal fundamentals. Its principles aligned exactly with MacDonald's <a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Catholic"><font color="#461d8b">Catholic</a></font> upbringing and the importance of the arts as emphasized by his family.&quot;<a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Goodridge_MacDonald#cite_note-houlihan-0"><font color="#461d8b">[1]</a></font><br />MacDonald &quot;published infrequently in Canadian literary periodicals,&quot; including a 1925 placement in the <a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Montreal_Group"><font color="#461d8b">McGill Fortnightly Review</a></font>. He did not publish another book of poetry, though, until 1946. He went on to publish four more volumes of poetry.<a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Goodridge_MacDonald#cite_note-trehearne-1"><font color="#461d8b">[2]</a></font><br />MacDonald died in January 1967. He was cremated and his ashes buried in the family plot in Fredericton.<a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Goodridge_MacDonald#cite_note-houlihan-0"><font color="#461d8b">[1]</a></font><br />On November 10, 1967, the <a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/University_of_New_Brunswick"><font color="#461d8b">University of New Brunswick</a></font> held a memorial service for Goodridge MacDonald, at which &quot;his poems and life were celebrated by numerous poets from Canada and the United States.&quot;<a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Goodridge_MacDonald#cite_note-houlihan-0"><font color="#461d8b">[1]</a></font><br />His Selected Poems were issued in 1970, edited by <a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php?title=R.G._Everson&action=edit&redlink=1"><font color="#924445">R.G. Everson</a></font>.<a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Goodridge_MacDonald#cite_note-trehearne-1"><font color="#461d8b">[2]</a></font><br />Writing<br />The New Brunswick Literary Encyclopedia (NBLE) characterizes Goodridge as a traditionalist writing in the style of the <a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Confederation_Poets"><font color="#461d8b">Confederation Poets</a></font>: &quot;his poetic style was similar to other poets in his family. His verse is technically proficient and emotionally powerful. As with many poets of the same period, his poetry is romantic, conservative, pastoral, and written in traditional metre and form.&quot;<a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Goodridge_MacDonald#cite_note-houlihan-0"><font color="#461d8b">[1]</a></font><br />Against that assessment, though, stands the fact of MacDonald's publication in the űber-[[modernist poetry in English|modernist [[Montreal Group|McGill Fortnightly Review. Anthologist <a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php?title=Brian_Trehearne&action=edit&redlink=1"><font color="#924445">Brian Trehearne</a></font> argued in 2010 that MacDonald in his later works was a thorough modernist: &quot;MacDonald commanded a terse, wry modernist style as current and pungent as that of any of the younger poets of the postwar period.&quot;<a href="http://www.wikinfo.org/index.php/Goodridge_MacDonald#cite_note-trehearne-1"><font color="#461d8b">[2]</a></font><br />It is inarguable that, like his family, MacDonald wrote much nature poetry.

He died 9 January 1967 in Montreal. During his lifetime, he published several collections of poetry, including Armageddon and Other Poems (1917), Beggar Makes Music (1950), Compass Reading and Others (1955), The Dying General and Other Poems (1946), Recent Poems (1957), and Twenty-four Poems (1958). A collection of his work, Selected Poems, was published posthumously in 1970. That selection included some of his poems that had not previously been published. MacDonald attained success in the 19th century romantic style, and had poems published in Delta, Queen&#8217;s Quarterly, Canadian Forum, Saturday Night, the Canadian Poetry Magazine, and The Fiddlehead.<br /><br />MacDonald&#8217;s family included several well known writers and poets, including Elizabeth Roberts MacDonald (his mother), Sir Charles G.D. Roberts, Theodore Goodridge Roberts, Bliss Carman, Dorothy Roberts, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and the painter Goodridge Roberts from Montreal. The Roberts were considered a dynasty in Canadian poetry and held a pre-eminent position in Canadian letters for most of the 19th century.<br /><br />MacDonald&#8217;s father, Samuel Archibald Roberts MacDonald, was a druggist in Fredericton and cousin to MacDonald&#8217;s mother before they married in 1896. His mother, Jane Elizabeth Gostwycke Roberts, was born and grew up in Westcock, Westmorland County. She was educated at the Collegiate School (Fredericton) and the University of New Brunswick. A major influence on Goodridge, his mother published several works, including Dream Verses, and Others in 1906. This collection of one hundred and seventeen poems attempted to capture the beauty of nature in the style to which the Roberts&#8217; poets had become accustomed. Considered delicate, she died in Ottawa in November 1922.<br /><br />Educated in local Fredericton schools until 1912, MacDonald moved with his family to Nelson, British Columbia, where he attended Nelson High School. From there he moved to Winnipeg in 1914. In 1915, his parents separated and his mother moved her sons to Ottawa. In Ottawa, MacDonald worked as a civil servant until 1916 when he enlisted in the war. From 1917 to 1918, he was deployed with the Queen&#8217;s Field Ambulance, Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF). He was honourably discharged from that position because of bad health.<br /><br />MacDonald also was an editor of The Montreal Herald, a prominent newspaper that supported the British constitution. In MacDonald&#8217;s time, it served as a voice for well educated British men and expressed ideals that reiterated liberal fundamentals. Its principles aligned exactly with MacDonald&#8217;s Catholic upbringing and the importance of the arts as emphasized by his family.<br /><br />MacDonald&#8217;s poetic style was similar to other poets in his family. His verse is technically proficient and emotionally powerful. As with many poets of the same period, his poetry is romantic, conservative, pastoral, and written in traditional metre and form. Many of his poems delight in the natural wonders of New Brunswick and the Atlantic Provinces, such as the poems &#8220;By St. Margaret&#8217;s Bay&#8221; and &#8220;Inlets and Mirrors,&#8221; which describes the Digby shore. As described by critic Northrop Frye, &#8220;the insight [his poems] express has much intelligence and humour&#8221; (93). Several of his later poems deal with war, specifically World War I, such as &#8220;Out of the West,&#8221; a poem describing a battalion of soldiers on their way to Europe: &#8220;Out of the West they come / Into West they go, / And ever the throbbing battle-drum / Beats on against the foe.&#8221; His poems about war were included in anthologies of Canadian war poetry such as Canadian Poems of the Great War (1918).<br /><br />After MacDonald&#8217;s death in Montreal on 9 January 1967, he was cremated and buried in his family plot in Fredericton. On 10 November 1967, a memorial service arranged by the University of New Brunswick was held in his honour. At the ceremony, his poems and life were celebrated by numerous poets from Canada and the United States.<br /><br />Lauren Houlihan<br />St. Thomas University<br /><br />BIBLIOGRAPHY OF PRIMARY SOURCES<br />MacDonald, Goodridge.
